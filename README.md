# AREWA-DS Projects
This is a collection os some projects done during AREWA Data Science Academy

### Project Description
This projects are exercises from the textbook we used during the Cohort 3.0 fellows. [click here to download](https://khwarizmi.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Eric_Matthes_Python_Crash_Course_A_Hands.pdf)

### Softwares

### Project objectives
The main objective of this project is to get hands on learning on the topics treated during this fellowship

### Table of content
1. [Sandwich program](https://github.com/Gabby210992/AREWA-DS---Projects/blob/main/sandwich.ipynb).
   - **Question:** Write a function that accepts a list of items a person wants on a sandwich. The function should have one parameter that collects as many items as the function call provides, and it should print a summary of the sandwich that is being ordered. Call the function three times, using a different num ber of arguments each time.
2. [User profile program](https://github.com/Gabby210992/AREWA-DS---Projects/blob/main/user_profile.ipynb)
   - **Question:** Start with a copy of user_profile.py from [page 153](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1muQhFz0kzZG72ZcBo1exF9t6EzjVvSe5/view?usp=sharing). Build a profile of yourself by calling build profile(), using your first and last names and three other key-value pairs that describe you.

4. [Cars program](https://github.com/Gabby210992/AREWA-DS---Projects/blob/main/car_program.ipynb)
   - **Question:** Write a function that stores information about a car in a dictionary. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Your function should work for a call like this one: car = make_car('subaru', 'outback', color='blue', tow_package=True) 
Print the dictionary thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly. 

6. [Restaurants program](https://github.com/Gabby210992/AREWA-DS---Projects/blob/main/restaurant_class.ipynb)
   - **Question:** Make a class called Restaurant. The __init__() method for Restaurant should store two attributes: a restaurant_name and a cuisine_type. Make a method called describe_restaurant() that prints these two pieces of information, and a method called open_restaurant() that prints a message indicating that the restaurant is open. Make an instance called restaurant from your class. Print the two attributes individually, and then call both methods.
